  <h1>Subaru Legacy</h1>
  <p>
    The <mark> Subaru Legacy </mark> (Japanese: スバル・レガシィ, Hepburn: Subaru Regashi) is a mid-size car built by Japanese
    automobile
    manufacturer Subaru since 1989. <br>
    The maker's flagship car, it is unique in its class for offering all-wheel drive as
    a standard feature, and Subaru's traditional boxer engine. <br>
    The Legacy was sold as the Liberty in Australia out of
    deference to Legacy Australia, an organisation dedicated to caring for the families of military service veterans.

  <h3>Загальні відомості</h3>
  <p>
    In 1996, a variant of the Legacy with heightened suspension called the Legacy Outback was introduced to compete in
    the burgeoning sport-utility vehicle class and proved to be a sales success for Subaru. The Outback line was split
    into its own model in 2008, known as the Subaru Outback.

    As of 2008, 3.6 million Legacy models have been built since its 1989 introduction.[1]

    Production of the Legacy ended in Japan in June 2020, with the sixth-generation Legacy being the last model produced
    and marketed in Japan.[2]
